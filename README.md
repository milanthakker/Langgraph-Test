# LangGraph Agent with Web Search

A simple LangGraph agent that can search the web using DuckDuckGo, exposed via a FastAPI server.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation)
- OpenAI API key

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
poetry install
```

2. Create a `.env` file from the example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

4. Add your OpenAI API key to the `.env` file:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
```

## Running the API

Start Phoenix and the agent together:

```bash
./start.sh
```

Or start them individually:

```bash
# Terminal 1 — Phoenix UI at http://localhost:6006
poetry run phoenix serve

# Terminal 2 — Agent API at http://localhost:8000
poetry run uvicorn api:app --reload
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:8000`.

## API Endpoints

### POST /chat

Send a message to the agent and receive a response.

**Request:**

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/chat \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"message": "What is the latest news about AI?"}'
```

**Response:**

```json
{
  "response": "Based on my search, here are the latest developments in AI..."
}
```

### GET /health

Health check endpoint.

```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/health
```

## How It Works

1. The agent receives a user message via the `/chat` endpoint
2. It calls GPT-4o with the message and available tools (DuckDuckGo search)
3. If the LLM decides to search, it executes the search and feeds results back
4. The loop continues until the LLM provides a final response
5. The response is returned to the user
